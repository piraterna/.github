Welcome to **Piraterna**!  
We are a non-political, non-profit organization based in Sweden, dedicated to promoting freedom through **100% open-source** and **free software**. Our mission is to create tools, libraries, and projects that empower users, respect their privacy, and foster collaboration.

## What We Stand For

- **Freedom**: Users should have the right to use, modify, and share software without restrictions.  
- **Transparency**: Our work is open to everyone, ensuring that all processes and decisions are clear and accessible.  
- **Collaboration**: We believe in building inclusive communities where everyone can contribute.  
- **Privacy and Autonomy**: Technology should empower individuals, not exploit them.  

## Join Us

Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, you can join us in our mission to build a freer, more open software ecosystem. You can get involved by contributing to our projects, discussing ideas, or simply using the tools we create.
